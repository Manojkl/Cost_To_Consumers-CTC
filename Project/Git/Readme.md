# Automating the git commit messages

### 📊 Estimated Number of GitHub Commit Messages Per Day

As of 2024–2025, GitHub does **\~100 million commits per month** (source: GitHub Octoverse reports, industry estimates). That’s roughly:

* **\~3.3 million commits per day**
* **\~2,300 commits per minute**

This includes all public and private repositories.

### ⏱️ Time & Mental Load Per Commit Message

Let’s break it down:

| Task                     | Avg Time        | Description                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Reading code changes** | 30–60 sec       | Reviewing your diff before committing |
| **Thinking of message**  | 20–60 sec       | Picking a concise, meaningful summary |
| **Typing it**            | 10–20 sec       | Writing the actual message            |
| **Total per commit**     | **1–2 minutes** |                                       |

### 🧠 Cognitive Load

For each commit:

* Developers **context switch** between coding and summarizing.
* For large diffs or unclear changes, this takes longer and leads to vague messages like:

  * `"Update"`
  * `"Fix bug"`
  * `"Refactor stuff"`

This inconsistency causes problems in debugging, collaboration, and release management later.

### 🔢 Multiply It Out

For **3.3 million commits/day**:

* **Time Spent Globally**:

  * At \~90 sec per commit → \~82,500 hours/day
  * That’s nearly **9.4 years of human time spent every single day**, just writing commit messages!

* **If Automated with LLMs**:

  * You could reduce it to near-zero manual effort.
  * Developers focus on reviewing the message, not composing it.

### 🧩 TL;DR

| Metric            | Value                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Commits/day       | \~3.3 million                   |
| Time per message  | \~1–2 minutes                   |
| Global daily time | \~80,000+ hours                 |
| LLM time cost     | <10 seconds, scalable instantly |
