The total distance between Kadaba and Panja is approximately 10 km, out of which around 8 km is in reasonably good condition. A 2 km stretch has a high concentration of potholes, but only the most severely affected sections—adding up to roughly 1 km in total—will be repaired. - from sources 

Potential reason for delay - rain, slow approval and processes of fund transfer (🤑), ...etc

Estimated time to repair - 3 days!! (India)
