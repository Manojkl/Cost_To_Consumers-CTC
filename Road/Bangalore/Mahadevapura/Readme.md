**Note on Name Currency:** While the names for the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister, BBMP Administrator, Chief Commissioner, and Special Commissioner (Projects) are based on recent verifiable information as of May 213213, the individuals in the roles of Engineer-in-Chief, Chief Engineer (Zone), Executive Engineer (Division), and Assistant Executive Engineer (Ward) can change frequently due to administrative transfers. For the most current individual in a specific lower-level role, it is recommended to consult official BBMP contact lists or public information channels.

Ramesh (Assistant Executive Engineer Ward 131), but confirming their *current* status in these very specific roles through widely accessible online sources is challenging.
