# Bengaluru(Bangalore)
BBMP had a contract covering 25 sweeping machines:

17 self-propelled machines
8 truck-mounted machines

No one verifies their work.

Create a checklist of what work has been carried out that day.
A camera system to monitor their work.
Use the tech giants. 
Service based companies can come forward to help.

Find the root cause of where the dust, silt are coming from and hold them accountable.

In summary, while the BBMP's most recent fleet under contract consisted of 25 machines, their operational status has been highly questionable, with reports indicating they were unfit for use and their contract had ended. The BBMP is currently exploring options for new machines and service-based tenders.
