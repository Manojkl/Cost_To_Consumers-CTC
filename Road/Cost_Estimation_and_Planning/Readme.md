# Interlock pavers

When calculating the **total cost of installing interlock pavers**, you need to consider **not just the cost of the blocks themselves**, but also the **other essential components and labor** involved in the complete process. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown for **making and installing 1 square meter of interlock pavement**:

---

## üß± 1. **Cost of Interlock Blocks**

* Assume **‚Çπ10 per piece** or **‚Çπ7-8 per piece** if optimized (from our earlier discussion)
* Pieces per sqm = 50
* Cost for blocks = ‚Çπ500 (‚Çπ10) or ‚Çπ350-400 (‚Çπ7-8)

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 3. **Labor Cost for Installation**

| Task                       | Description                              | Cost (‚Çπ per sqm) |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Laying interlock blocks    | Manual placing, aligning, and compacting | ‚Çπ100 - 150       |
| Joint filling (sand sweep) | Filling gaps between blocks with sand    | ‚Çπ20 - 30         |
| Final compaction           | Using plate compactor                    | ‚Çπ30 - 50         |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes:**

* Costs vary based on **location**, **scale of work**, **availability of materials**, and **labor rates**.
* Prices are indicative for **India (semi-urban to urban areas)**.
* Using **heavier machinery** or **automated laying** may increase labor efficiency but add fixed costs.
* Thickness and strength of pavers affect cost significantly ‚Äî thinner, optimized pavers reduce block costs but may impact durability.

To do

- Research on other cost effective and efficient methods that are in standard with the interlock pavers
- Policy for the same
- Timeline for the same and when to achive 100% of them. 
- Promotion of people who are taking the initiative and implementing them
- Research on quality standards (Look at developed countries)
- Formulate the problem as politicial based on the places and peoples mindset.
- Map the entire nation and find where all needs to be implemented.
- Collect data on poor work(shitting work and good work).
- Estimate for upgrading the entire nation road, sidewalks, shops entrance.
- Identify where the soil, dust, wastes are coming to road. Take appropriate actions for the same.
- .....etc

Note: Research on other available machines in the market.
Important: In India it will work only few months, then breakdown happens and no one maintains them. Make a system to make all of the things up and work accordingly. Ex. A camera system given to panchayat in Karnataka only worked for few months. After that no one cares!! Solve this problem. Find root cause.
Mainly due to laziness with people working in government, corruption, people don't ask questions....etc to be updated
Make all people involved. Research on potential solutions to this problem and also on relaity.
