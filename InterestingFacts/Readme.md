### ✅ Summary Table

| Education Level                        | Approximate % of Indians (age 15+) |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Less than 10th grade                   | \~ 50–60%                          |
| Up to 12th grade (including 12th pass) | \~ 40–60%                          |

Quality education in India

| Indicator                        | Approx % achieving “quality” |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Primary literacy & numeracy      | 36–60% proficient            |
| 8th graders reading grade-2 text | \~56%                        |
| Secondary completion             | \~51%                        |
| College grads employable         | \~50%                        |
| Vocational grads employable      | 28–34%                       |

🔍 What does “quality education” mean here?

Education is only truly quality when students:

- Learn the basics (reading, math).
- Stay in school through secondary levels.
- Acquire skills that make them employable.
- Experience well-resourced, engaged schooling (good teachers, infrastructure, innovative, not rote-based).

📌 Bottom line
- Roughly 40–64% of primary-schoolers aren’t learning basics.
- Only about half make it through upper secondary.
- Only ~50% of graduates and worse in vocational training are actually employable.
- Access perceptions are positive, but real quality remains limited for most—especially in government and rural settings.

## Mindset Formation


A person's mindset develops and stabilizes in phases across life, with decreasing plasticity (ability to change) as age increases. However, no age is a hard cutoff — change is possible at any age, just harder due to neurological, psychological, and environmental factors.

General Timeline of Mindset Development:

🧒 0–6 years (Early Childhood):

Brain is extremely plastic.

Language, emotion, and core beliefs about safety, love, and the world are formed.

Absorbs information without much critical thinking — foundational mindset starts forming.


🧑‍🏫 7–12 years (Late Childhood):

Begins to develop social identity, self-concept, and moral understanding.

Influenced by parents, teachers, and environment.

Basic worldview becomes more stable but still modifiable.


🧑‍🎓 13–25 years (Adolescence to Young Adult):

Critical period for mindset formation.

Prefrontal cortex (responsible for reasoning, planning, impulse control) continues developing until about age 25.

Beliefs about self-worth, politics, religion, and career direction often solidify here.

Most flexible phase for shifting values, if exposed to the right ideas.


🧑‍💼 25–35 years:

Mindset starts to stabilize significantly.

People often settle into identity, habits, and belief systems.

Still open to change (especially through major life events), but change requires more conscious effort.


👨‍👩‍🦳 35–50 years:

Neuroplasticity decreases.

People become more resistant to changing long-held beliefs.

Confirmation bias increases — they seek information that supports existing views.

However, major shocks (illness, trauma, divorce, career shifts) can still trigger change.


🧓 50+ years:

Change is least likely, though not impossible.

Set patterns and mental models dominate unless disrupted by strong motivation or necessity.

Summary Table:

Age Range	Mindset Characteristics	Changeability

| Age Range | Mindset Characteristics                       | Changeability         |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 0–6       | Absorbs without filters; foundational beliefs  | Very high              |
| 7–12      | Social and moral identity starts forming       | High                   |
| 13–25     | Beliefs form; brain maturing                   | **Highest (critical)** |
| 25–35     | Stabilization begins                           | Medium to high         |
| 35–50     | Resistant to change                            | Medium to low          |
| 50+       | Strongly ingrained patterns                    | Low                    |


---

Final Insight:

🧠 The mindset becomes most resistant to change after 35–40, but meaningful transformation is always possible through intense self-reflection, education, therapy, or life-altering events.

**Notes on Consumption Data:**

* **Total Consumption (TWh):** This refers to the total electricity consumed in the country, not just by households. Exact TWh figures for the most recent year are not always immediately available, so some are approximations based on per capita data and population, or a recent total.
* **Per Capita Consumption (kWh/year):** This represents the total electricity consumption divided by the total population. For some countries, the most readily available per capita data is for *primary energy consumption*, which includes other forms of energy beyond just electricity. Where this is the case, it's noted.
* **Per Household/Residential Consumption (kWh/year):** This is the focus of your request, representing the average electricity used by a single household or within the residential sector.
* **Year (Total/Per Capita):** The year for which the Total Consumption and/or Per Capita Consumption data is most relevant.
* **Year (Per Household):** The year for which the Per Household/Residential Consumption data is available.

**Specific Notes on Per Household/Residential Consumption:**

* **United States:** Average household uses about 10,500–10,800 kWh/year, with regional variation (Hawaii ~6,200 kWh; Louisiana ~14,700 kWh).
* **South Korea:** Average household electricity consumption in August 2024 was 363 kWh, which is approximately 4,356 kWh annually if consistent, but could be lower as an annual average. The table uses the approximate annual value based on this.
* **Australia:** Daily usage varies by household size (e.g., single-person ~7.66 kWh/day or ~2,800 kWh/year; four-person ~17.95-21.36 kWh/day or ~6,550-7,800 kWh/year). The figure provided in the table is an estimated average for varied household sizes.
* **India:** Typical urban household uses ~90 kWh/month (~1,080 kWh/year), though urban Delhi households can consume ~250–270 kWh/month (~3,000 kWh/year). The national average for typical urban households is used.
* **Russia:** Residential sector accounted for 18% of total electricity consumption (997 TWh) in 2023. Given a population of 143 million and an average household size of ~2.5, this implies a per-household consumption in the range of 1,200-1,400 kWh.
* **China:** Residential electricity consumption per capita was 987 kWh in 2022. Due to the diverse household sizes in China, a direct household consumption figure is less commonly published; hence, the per capita residential figure is used as an approximation.
* **France:** Residential sector accounted for 38% of total electricity consumption (473.672 TWh) in 2023. Per capita consumption was 6.66 MWh. Using average household size (approx. 2.2 persons), per household consumption is estimated around 2,530 kWh/year.
* **Italy:** Per capita electricity consumption was around 4,900 kWh in 2024, and electricity consumption in the residential sector accounts for a significant portion. Assuming an average household size of 2.4 persons (EU average), this leads to an approximate per-household figure.
* **Mexico:** Residential sector accounted for 24.7% of total electricity consumption (346.466 TWh) in 2023. Per capita consumption was 2.373 MWh. Using average household size (approx. 3.5 persons), per household consumption is estimated around 580 kWh/year.
* **Poland:** Average energy consumption in households in 2021 was 24.6 GJ per inhabitant. Converting GJ to kWh (1 GJ = 277.78 kWh) and assuming an average household size of 2.5 persons in Poland, this equates to approximately 2,300 kWh per household.
* **Saudi Arabia:** Total residential electricity consumption was 152,782 GWh in 2023. With approximately 8.65 million households in Saudi Arabia in 2023, the per household consumption is around 17,650 kWh/year.
* **Brazil:** Total household electricity consumption was 15,637 GWh in January 2025. With approximately 69.5 million households in Brazil (2022 data), the monthly average is around 225 kWh, leading to an annual average of ~2,700 kWh. The figure provided (2,250 kWh) is a rough average derived from various regional reports, accounting for potential variations.

🌍 Global Injections Estimate

WHO estimates at least 16 billion injections are administered worldwide each year—an average of approximately 43.8 million injections per day ().

🔍 Breakdown by Purpose:
	•	Therapeutic (curative drug administration): ~90% of all injections  ￼.
	•	Immunizations: ~5% ().
	•	Other uses (e.g., blood products, contraceptives): ~remaining 5%  ￼.

Thus:
	•	Therapeutic: ~39.4 million/day
	•	Immunizations: ~2.2 million/day
	•	Other: ~2.2 million/day

⸻

🧾 Daily Global Total:

≈ 43.8 million injections per day

(16 billion ÷ 365 ≈ 43.8 million)

⸻

✅ Supporting Insight:
	•	WHO confirms “every year at least 16 billion injections are administered worldwide,” with ~90% for curative, ~5% for immunization, and ~5% for other purposes  ￼ ￼.
	•	Another source reiterates: “…16 billion injections annually, 5% for immunization and 95% for curative purposes”  ￼.

📌 Summary Table

Injection Type	% of Total	Daily Count
Therapeutic (drugs)	~90%	~39.4 million
Immunization	~5%	~2.2 million
Other (contraception etc.)	~5%	~2.2 million
Total All Types	100%	~43.8 million/day

If you take all the nerves in a grown adult human body and stretch them end to end, their total length is estimated to be around:

> 🧠 Approximately 100,000 kilometers (≈ 62,000 miles)



That's more than twice the circumference of the Earth!


---

🔬 Why So Long?

The number seems huge because:

Every organ, muscle, skin cell, joint, gland is connected by networks of nerve fibers.

Even the tiniest areas of your skin are served by microscopic nerve endings.

The autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic) weaves through the entire body.



---

🧬 Breakdown by Type:

System	Approx. Length

Peripheral nerves (body-wide)	~100,000 km
Sensory nerves	Tens of thousands of km
Motor nerves	Tens of thousands of km
Autonomic nerves	Several thousand km


Note: This includes individual axons, not just the big visible nerve bundles.


---

🚸 For Comparison:

Thing	Length

Earth's circumference	~40,000 km
Human circulatory system (blood vessels)	~100,000 km
Human nerve system (total axon length)	~100,000 km
