🧾 Interpretation & Context

UNEP’s Food Waste Index (2024) indicates that of all food wasted globally, retail accounts for ~13 % and households ~60 %  .

USDA/EPA data show that the US loses ~30 % of food at the retail + consumer level, though exact retail-only percentages are unclear  .

UK and France provide more detailed public data: UK estimates ~3 % of food waste occurs at retail; France reports ~11 % from supermarkets  .

🤔 Key Takeaways

1. Retail-level food waste across major economies hovers around 10–13 % of total waste, following global trends.

2. Exceptionally low retail waste in the UK (~3 %) may reflect stronger redistribution efforts (e.g., donations, markdowns).

3. US’s ~30 % loss includes both retail and consumer waste, making country-level comparisons nuanced.

4. Data quality varies—only a few countries (e.g., US, UK, Japan) publicly track retail-level figures.
