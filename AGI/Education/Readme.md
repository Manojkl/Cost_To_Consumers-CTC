# Curiosity in age groups

🧠 Peak Curiosity Ages (Globally Observed Patterns)
| Age Range       | Curiosity Level                  | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **3–6 years**   | 🌟 Extremely High                | Children ask the most "why" questions; curiosity is natural and unfiltered.                  |
| **7–10 years**  | 🌟 Very High                     | Still driven by discovery; school encourages exploration (varies by system).                 |
| **11–14 years** | 🔄 Varies widely                 | Curiosity often dips slightly due to academic pressure, but rebounds if nurtured.            |
| **15–18 years** | 🔄 Strong but focused            | Curiosity narrows to areas of personal or academic interest; shaped by culture and pressure. |
| **18–25 years** | 🌟 High if autonomy is supported | In countries with flexible higher education and innovation cultures, curiosity flourishes.   |


🌍 By Region: Notable Trends
| Region                                       | Age Range of High Curiosity                                             | Notes                                                                                          |

| **Japan, South Korea**                       | 3–9 (very high), dips during 10–18                                      | High early, but rote systems often suppress curiosity in middle/high school.                   |
| **India**                                    | 3–8 (very high), declines after                                         | Rote systems and exam focus reduce open-ended curiosity, unless outside-school support exists. |
