## Increasing Shelf Life

Increasing the shelf life of fruits and vegetables **without chemicals**:

### 🌿 **1. Shelf Life in Open Spaces**

* **Fruits & vegetables spoil faster** in open markets due to heat, sunlight, and air exposure.
* Typical shelf life ranges from **1–7 days** in open conditions (less for leafy greens, more for root crops).

---

### ⏳ **2. Natural Shelf Life Extension (No Chemicals)**

| Produce Type     | Normal Life | With Natural Methods | % Increase |
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| Leafy Greens     | 1–2 days    | 3–5 days             | +150–400%  |
| Bananas          | 2–4 days    | 5–6 days             | +50–100%   |
| Tomatoes         | 2–4 days    | 5–7 days             | +75%       |
| Apples           | 5–7 days    | 10–15 days           | +100%      |
| Onions, Potatoes | 10–20 days  | 30–45 days           | +100–200%  |

---

### ✅ **3. Cost-Effective, Natural Methods**

| Method                       | Cost     | Shelf Life Boost |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Clay pot storage / Mitticool | ₹0–₹2000 | +50–300%         |
| Banana leaf / newspaper wrap | ₹0       | +50–150%         |
| Hanging bananas / tomatoes   | ₹0       | +50–100%         |
| Neem leaves / turmeric       | ₹10–₹50  | +50–100%         |
| Cold water dip (for greens)  | Free     | +100–200%        |
| Jute sacks / bamboo crates   | ₹20–₹300 | +50–150%         |

---

### 🌍 **4. Global Impact**

* **\~40–50% of fruits & vegetables are wasted globally**.
* **Reducing spoilage by just 2–3 days** can:

  * Save **400–500 million tons of food/year**
  * Save **\$100–200 billion** globally
  * Cut **GHG emissions by 1–2 gigatons CO₂e**
  * Boost **farmer income by 10–30%**
  * Improve **food security and nutrition**

---

### 🧠 **Key Takeaways**

* Natural methods are **low-cost, scalable**, and **chemical-free**.
* They can **double or triple shelf life** for many types of produce.
* Ideal for **small vendors, local farmers, households**, and **rural markets**.
* Also contributes to **climate action**, **zero hunger**, and **waste reduction goals**.
