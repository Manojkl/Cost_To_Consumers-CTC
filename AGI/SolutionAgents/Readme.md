# SolutionAgents

Define a problem with all the details.
Give the problem to two or more Agents. Each Agent give a response and other Agents find the flaws in the response or give better solution, cycle repeats until to a point when both agree to some level.
Maybe add a monitor agent(Can be AI or Human) to oversee the responses.
Application:

1. Coding
2. Research problems/Questions 

## SolutionAgents

Transform the problem from linguistic domain to visual domain and try to solve.

- Solve directly.
- Solve using solution/critique model.
- Combine linguistic and visual domain together to solve the problem.
- Look into different perspectives and choose a path of most likely to be optimal. Some perspectives helps to solve problems. Ex. Dual nature of light

## Image and Video domain

- Give a image and ask questions on the image. E.g What a person is doing in the image or video, what else can he do?
- Biology, what is happening in the video.
- Simulation, give ask it to critque the way of doing, ask suggetions on what is the better way to do it.
- Given a piece of work as video, ask the system to tell what is the optimized way of doing things.
- Learn the better way of doing things pattern.
- Add the sound domain to describe.
- Sound domain as hint to solve the problem.
- To LLM give a sample video and ask it to generate based on that format.
- Critize the video generated by a model and based on critique generate better videos considering the critique.

## Sound domain

- Critize the output of a ai sound generator

## Application 

- Apply it to research papers, apply different fields approach to one another

## Error propagation 

- Study on error propagation 
- Mitigation steps to stop or minimise the error
- Apply it to different domains. E.g Error propagation in a code.
- Can we measure or find the correctness of fundamental understanding and how it will impact the error propagation

## Electronics circuits design

- Design based on the requirement design a circuit by solving the mathematical equations and design them
- Consider the constraints
- Come up with a new ways of designing the circuit or new technology

## Find the optimisation techniques 

- Given the optimal solution and the problem ask the llm to find the optimisation used to that peoblem to get the optimal solution
- Maybe that model is better at critiques
- Straight way find the model that gives the optimal solution
- Try to extract the optimisation pattern from the nature

## Alignment Issue

- Issue due to alignment to achieve its goals

## Experiment

- Give all the data that earth is the center of solar system also give observations of people experiment data that explains the sun is the center of the solar system ask it to critize. Check if it's coming to the correct conclusions.
- Can AI solve the reasoning video game without being trained on the data with minimal number of iterations. RL with very less iterations.

# Biology into mathematics

- Describe the biology and represent them into mathematical terms. 
- Language domain to visual domain.

Training a multi modality model

train a text, image, sound etc modalities data in a single model
train them in separate model and interact their findings to each other

Even optimize this approach,
- Call appropriate llm based on response or task/ Build a multi agent system 
- Instead of two consider more llms colloborating to give better solution 
- Reinforce the learning by taking output from multiple llms/ then decide what is the best model to pass this output as input to
- Summarise the result and send
- Send along with the reasoning 

Extracting underlying concepts/ideas from different fields maybe humans created or from nature and apply it other fields to solve the problems

Reasoning the image

- Describe the image with the AI model, as comprehensive as possible
- To improve the understanding feed this description to reasoning models, and let it generate as many questions as possible from this description and feed this to description model to get answers.
