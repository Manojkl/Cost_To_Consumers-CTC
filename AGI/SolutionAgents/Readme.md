# SolutionAgents

Define a problem with all the details.
Give the problem to two or more Agents. Each Agent give a response and other Agents find the flaws in the response or give better solution, cycle repeats until to a point when both agree to some level.
Maybe add a monitor agent to oversee the responses.
Application:

1. Coding
2. Research problems/Questions 

## SolutionAgents

Transform the problem from linguistic domain to visual domain and try to solve.

- Solve directly.
- Solve using solution/critique model.
- Combine linguistic and visual domain together to solve the problem.
- Look into different perspectives and choose a path of most likely to be optimal. Some perspectives helps to solve problems. Ex. Dual nature of light


## Image and Video domain

- Give a image and ask questions on the image. E.g What a person is doing in the image or video, what else can he do?
- Biology, what is happening in the video.
- Simulation, give ask it to critque the way of doing, ask suggetions on what is the better way to do it.
- Given a piece of work as video, ask the system to tell what is the optimized way of doing things.
- Learn the better way of doing things pattern.
- Add the sound domain to describe.
- Sound domain as hint to solve the problem.
- To LLM give a sample video and ask it to generate based on that format.
- Critize the video generated by a model and based on critique generate better videos considering the critique.

## Sound domain

- Critize the output of a ai sound generator

## Application 

- Apply it to research papers, apply different fields approach to one another

## Error propagation 

- Study on error propagation 
- Mitigation steps to stop or minimise the error

## Electronics circuits design

- Design based on the requirement design a circuit by solving the mathematical equations and design them
- Consider the constraints
- Come up with a new ways of designing the circuit or new technology
