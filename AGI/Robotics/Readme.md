#### Definiton of robotics

"Robotics is the branch of engineering and science that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots." ‚Äî ‚ÄúIntroduction to Robotics‚Äù by John J. Craig

"Robotics deals with the study of intelligent machines capable of performing tasks in the real world by sensing, planning, and acting." - ‚ÄúRobotics: Modelling, Planning and Control‚Äù by Siciliano & Sciavicco

##### In simpler terms

Robotics is the science and technology of building machines (robots) that can do tasks like humans or animals ‚Äî such as moving, picking things up, or making decisions.

#### Core Concepts

- Perception: Using sensors to gather information from the environment.
- Planning: Making decisions based on input (e.g., navigation, manipulation).
- Control: Executing movements or actions through actuators.
- Autonomy: Some degree of decision-making without human input.
- Interaction: Responding to the environment or humans.

## Humanoid Robots

### üîπ **University Programs and Humanoid Robotics Research**

* **User asked** for a global breakdown of universities that offer:

  * **All three programs**: Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science.
  * **Any one or more** of these.
* **Breakdown requested by**:

  * Country.
  * Education level: undergraduate, graduate, PhD.
* **Humanoid robotics data requested**, including:

  * Institutions **currently active** in humanoid robotics research.
  * Institutions that have **done work in the past**.
  * Institutions that **currently possess humanoid robots**.

> **Findings**:

* No comprehensive global database exists listing exact counts per country and level.
* Approximate global estimate: **930 institutions** offer engineering/computer science programs accredited by ABET.
* Several key countries (Japan, USA, Germany, China, South Korea, Singapore, South Africa) have institutions known for humanoid robotics.
* Active research institutions include **Waseda University**, **KAIST**, **KIT**, **Stanford**, among others.
* Institutions in countries like **South Africa** recently entered the field (e.g., Stellenbosch University, TUT).

### üîπ **Capabilities of Humanoid Robots Compared to Other Robots**

* **User asked** what percentage of tasks done by other robots could be handled by humanoid robots.
* Also asked what percentage of **global human work** could be done by humanoid robots, versus work requiring specialized robots.

> **Estimates**:

* **\~50%** of tasks done by specialized robots could, in principle, be done by humanoid robots‚Äîbut often **less efficiently**. (Multiple robots for different tasks and a single robot for various tasks)
* **\~25‚Äì30%** of global work (manual labor, routine cognitive tasks) could be done by humanoid robots.
* **\~40‚Äì50%** of tasks require **non-humanoid robots** due to speed, precision, form factor, or environment.
* Remaining **\~20‚Äì30%** of global work requires **humans** (creative, emotional, strategic tasks).

To do: MindMap of robots by types of robots, application areas.

To do: Research on how many Universities are working on Humanoid Robots in different countries. Start new or already existing open source framework to work on, everyone contributes to that single/multiple repositories, by countries or international while maintaining the standards.

Make the university work on real-world, commercial-type humanoid robots, not only toy robots.
The majority work in commercial-level robots.

## Cost reduction of Humanoid robots

Here‚Äôs a **summary** of how much humanoid robot prices can realistically drop with large-scale production ‚Äî globally and in **China**:

---

### üåç **Global Scenario (General Estimate)**

| Scale of Production             | Estimated Cost per Unit | In INR                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Prototype (1‚Äì10 units)          | \$100k‚Äì\$300k           | ‚Çπ80 lakh ‚Äì ‚Çπ2.4 crore  |
| Small Batch (100‚Äì1,000 units)   | \$50k‚Äì\$100k            | ‚Çπ40 lakh ‚Äì ‚Çπ80 lakh    |
| Mass Production (10,000+ units) | **\$10k‚Äì\$30k**         | **‚Çπ8 lakh ‚Äì ‚Çπ25 lakh** |
| Ultra-Mass (100k+ units/year)   | **\$5k‚Äì\$15k**          | **‚Çπ4 lakh ‚Äì ‚Çπ12 lakh** |

* Key savings from bulk procurement, automated assembly, and shared software.
* Prices won‚Äôt go below ‚Çπ4‚Äì5 lakh without reducing functionality.

### üá®üá≥ **China Scenario**

| Scale of Production           | Estimated Cost per Unit (China) | In INR                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Prototype                     | \$80k‚Äì\$200k                    | ‚Çπ65 lakh ‚Äì ‚Çπ1.6 crore   |
| Small Batch                   | \$30k‚Äì\$70k                     | ‚Çπ25 lakh ‚Äì ‚Çπ60 lakh     |
| Mass Production               | **\$6k‚Äì\$20k**                  | **‚Çπ5 lakh ‚Äì ‚Çπ16 lakh**  |
| Ultra-Mass (100k+ units/year) | **\$3k‚Äì\$8k**                   | **‚Çπ2.5 lakh ‚Äì ‚Çπ7 lakh** |

* Cheaper due to local component sourcing, low-cost labor, and government incentives.
* China can reach **‚Çπ2.5‚Äì5 lakh** per unit for basic, functional humanoids by 2026‚Äì2028.

---

### üîç Bottom Line

* **Globally**: Realistic minimum price = **‚Çπ4‚Äì5 lakh** (mass scale).
* **In China**: Realistic minimum = **‚Çπ2.5‚Äì3 lakh** (ultra-mass scale).
* Still-expensive components: **AI chips, batteries, precision actuators**.

| **Chassis & Skeleton**                       | \$5,000 ‚Äì \$15,000   | **\$500 ‚Äì \$2,000**   | Big reduction with injection-molded frames or aluminum stamping            |
| **Sensors (Cameras, IMUs, LIDAR, etc.)**     | \$2,000 ‚Äì \$8,000    | **\$300 ‚Äì \$800**     | China has domestic sensors at a fraction of global cost                    |
| **Compute (Jetson, Orin, custom AI boards)** | \$2,000 ‚Äì \$5,000    | **\$500 ‚Äì \$1,000**   | Custom boards or local equivalents can cut cost                            |
| **Hands/Grippers**                           | \$2,000 ‚Äì \$5,000    | **\$300 ‚Äì \$800**     | Depends on level of dexterity; basic grippers are cheap                    |

### ü§ñ **Life Expectancy of Humanoid Robots**

* Typically **5‚Äì10 years** depending on usage and maintenance.
* With part replacements and software upgrades, lifespan can extend to **15+ years**.
* Rapid tech advancements.

---

### üöó **Comparable to Cars**

* Like cars, robots need **regular maintenance**, **part upgrades**, and face **wear and tear**.
* Can be **kept running longer** with care, but newer models make older ones outdated.

---

### üß† **Modular Approach (Like Human Body)**

* Humanoid robots can be **built with modular parts**, allowing upgrades like:

  * Battery = Kidney/Heart
  * Motors = Joints
  * Sensors = Eyes/Nose/Ears/Skin/Tongue/Awareness of surroundings
  * CPU/GPU = Brain
* Faulty parts can be **replaced just like organ transplants**, keeping the robot functional for decades.

---

### üí∏ **Return on Investment (ROI)**

* Depends on:

  * **Robot cost**: ‚Çπ5 lakh‚Äì‚Çπ1 crore+
  * **Annual maintenance**: ‚Çπ50k‚Äì‚Çπ2 lakh
  * **Human labor cost saved**: ‚Çπ2 lakh‚Äì‚Çπ8 lakh/year
* **Typical payback period**:

  * **2‚Äì3 years** in ideal factory/service cases
  * **4‚Äì6 years** in average use
  * **7‚Äì10+ years** for advanced research models
* After the payback period, the robot generates **net profit**.

### **Advantage**

* Automating the repetitive task
* Saving time
* Labour shortage
* Humans spend time on more relevant tasks
* Elderly support
* As a companion (Model of a person in humanoid robots)
* Support children and take care of them
* A hologram of a person when talking on a call (Isolate internet connection?)
* Monitor the health of a person (Body status)

Divide the larger task into smaller, manageable components and assign them to the university/individuals/competition/open_challenge/educational_institutions/..etc for execution.
