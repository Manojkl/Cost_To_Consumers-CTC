#### Definiton of robotics

"Robotics is the branch of engineering and science that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots." ‚Äî ‚ÄúIntroduction to Robotics‚Äù by John J. Craig

"Robotics deals with the study of intelligent machines capable of performing tasks in the real world by sensing, planning, and acting." - ‚ÄúRobotics: Modelling, Planning and Control‚Äù by Siciliano & Sciavicco

##### In simpler terms

Robotics is the science and technology of building machines (robots) that can do tasks like humans or animals ‚Äî such as moving, picking things up, or making decisions.

#### Core Concepts

- Perception: Using sensors to gather information from the environment.
- Planning: Making decisions based on input (e.g., navigation, manipulation).
- Control: Executing movements or actions through actuators.
- Autonomy: Some degree of decision-making without human input.
- Interaction: Responding to the environment or humans.

## Humanoid Robots

### üîπ **University Programs and Humanoid Robotics Research**

* **User asked** for a global breakdown of universities that offer:

  * **All three programs**: Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science.
  * **Any one or more** of these.
* **Breakdown requested by**:

  * Country.
  * Education level: undergraduate, graduate, PhD.
* **Humanoid robotics data requested**, including:

  * Institutions **currently active** in humanoid robotics research.
  * Institutions that have **done work in the past**.
  * Institutions that **currently possess humanoid robots**.

> **Findings**:

* No comprehensive global database exists listing exact counts per country and level.
* Approximate global estimate: **930 institutions** offer engineering/computer science programs accredited by ABET.
* Several key countries (Japan, USA, Germany, China, South Korea, Singapore, South Africa) have institutions known for humanoid robotics.
* Active research institutions include **Waseda University**, **KAIST**, **KIT**, **Stanford**, among others.
* Institutions in countries like **South Africa** recently entered the field (e.g., Stellenbosch University, TUT).

---

### üîπ **Capabilities of Humanoid Robots Compared to Other Robots**

* **User asked** what percentage of tasks done by other robots could be handled by humanoid robots.
* Also asked what percentage of **global human work** could be done by humanoid robots, versus work requiring specialized robots.

> **Estimates**:

* **\~50%** of tasks done by specialized robots could, in principle, be done by humanoid robots‚Äîbut often **less efficiently**. (Multiple robots for different tasks and a single robot for various tasks)
* **\~25‚Äì30%** of global work (manual labor, routine cognitive tasks) could be done by humanoid robots.
* **\~40‚Äì50%** of tasks require **non-humanoid robots** due to speed, precision, form factor, or environment.
* Remaining **\~20‚Äì30%** of global work requires **humans** (creative, emotional, strategic tasks).

To do: MindMap of robots by types of robots, application areas.

To do: Research on how many Universities are working on Humanoid Robots in different countries. Start new or already existing open source framework to work on, everyone contributes to that single/multiple repositories, by countries or international while maintaining the standards.

Make the university work on real-world, commercial-type humanoid robots, not only toy robots.
The majority work in commercial-level robots.
