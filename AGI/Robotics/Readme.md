# Robotics

#### Definiton of robotics

"Robotics is the branch of engineering and science that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots." — “Introduction to Robotics” by John J. Craig

"Robotics deals with the study of intelligent machines capable of performing tasks in the real world by sensing, planning, and acting." - “Robotics: Modelling, Planning and Control” by Siciliano & Sciavicco

##### In simpler terms

Robotics is the science and technology of building machines (robots) that can do tasks like humans or animals — such as moving, picking things up, or making decisions.

#### Core Concepts

- Perception: Using sensors to gather information from the environment.
- Planning: Making decisions based on input (e.g., navigation, manipulation).
- Control: Executing movements or actions through actuators.
- Autonomy: Some degree of decision-making without human input.
- Interaction: Responding to the environment or humans.

## Humanoid Robots

### 🔹 **University Programs and Humanoid Robotics Research**

* **User asked** for a global breakdown of universities that offer:

  * **All three programs**: Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science.
  * **Any one or more** of these.
* **Breakdown requested by**:

  * Country.
  * Education level: undergraduate, graduate, PhD.
* **Humanoid robotics data requested**, including:

  * Institutions **currently active** in humanoid robotics research.
  * Institutions that have **done work in the past**.
  * Institutions that **currently possess humanoid robots**.

> **Findings**:

* No comprehensive global database exists listing exact counts per country and level.
* Approximate global estimate: **930 institutions** offer engineering/computer science programs accredited by ABET.
* Several key countries (Japan, USA, Germany, China, South Korea, Singapore, South Africa) have institutions known for humanoid robotics.
* Active research institutions include **Waseda University**, **KAIST**, **KIT**, **Stanford**, among others.
* Institutions in countries like **South Africa** recently entered the field (e.g., Stellenbosch University, TUT).

---

### 🔹 **Capabilities of Humanoid Robots Compared to Other Robots**

* **User asked** what percentage of tasks done by other robots could be handled by humanoid robots.
* Also asked what percentage of **global human work** could be done by humanoid robots, versus work requiring specialized robots.

> **Estimates**:

* **\~50%** of tasks done by specialized robots could, in principle, be done by humanoid robots—but often **less efficiently**. (Multiple robots for different tasks and a single robot for various tasks)
* **\~25–30%** of global work (manual labor, routine cognitive tasks) could be done by humanoid robots.
* **\~40–50%** of tasks require **non-humanoid robots** due to speed, precision, form factor, or environment.
* Remaining **\~20–30%** of global work requires **humans** (creative, emotional, strategic tasks).

To do: MindMap of robots by types of robots, application areas.

To do: Research on how many Universities are working on Humanoid Robots in different countries. Start new or already existing open source framework to work on, everyone contributes to that single/multiple repositories, by countries or international while maintaining the standards.

Make the university work on real-world, commercial-type humanoid robots, not only toy robots.
The majority work in commercial-level robots.
