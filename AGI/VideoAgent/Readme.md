# VideoAgent

A llm that translates video domain to different domains (text,audio, embedding domain)without loosing information, one approach is speech to text along with all dimensions of audio also translate clear representation of image data to text or embeddings and then process that information.

A llm that captures the entire information in a video (along with audio) domain and translate it into different domains like text since processing video domain is much more expensive than other domains, also study the positive and negative of the same.
Is it advantage to translate to other domains rather than remaining in original domain in terms of performance and other parameters?

Model that generate embedding based on text and video data.
