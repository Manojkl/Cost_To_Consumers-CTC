# DatasetAgent

Develop an open-source dataset tracking individuals or animals from birth to death across diverse communities, capturing sensory data—including vision, sound, smell, taste, and brain signals—using privacy-preserving, anonymized wearable devices, such as sensor-equipped sunglasses.

Approach:

- Data Collection: Utilize wearable devices, like sensor-integrated sunglasses, to gather comprehensive sensory data:

    -- Vision: Capture visual information through integrated cameras.
    -- Sound: Record auditory data using built-in microphones.
    -- Smell: Detect olfactory cues with chemical sensors.
    -- Taste: Monitor gustatory responses, potentially through innovative sensor technology.
    -- Brain Signals: Measure neural activity via non-invasive EEG sensors.
    -- Open Source: Ensure the dataset and associated tools are freely available for research and development purposes.

Privacy Preservation: Implement robust anonymization techniques to protect individual identities and comply with ethical standards.

Diverse Subjects: Include a wide range of living beings to enhance the dataset's applicability across various studies.

This initiative aims to provide a rich, ethically sourced dataset for advancing research in fields such as neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and behavioral science.

# Smell

Collect wide range of smells.
Associate smells with the sound.
Find the correlation.
How much affect smell has on individuals decisions taking.
Associate smell with places, 

## Dataset Agent

Describe what kind of dataset you want, in plain English, write the requirements; it searches through all the available data and gives the available data.
