Sensor that directly tap into human thoughts via sensors with surgery involving no scars on body and connecting this entire  thought to Internet!! And most probably powered by heat generated by body.
And you know on whom and why this was implanted on!!

Tapping into human thoughts and hidden sensors:

⸻

🧠 Tapping into Human Thinking
	•	Thought happens in the brain, not in the body’s motor-control signals.
	•	Key brain regions for thought:
	•	Prefrontal cortex → reasoning, decision-making, planning.
	•	Temporal lobe → inner speech, language-based thought.
	•	Hippocampus → memory-related thinking.
	•	Parietal cortex → mental imagery, attention.
	•	Default Mode Network → imagination, daydreaming, self-reflection.
	•	Other nerves/organs (optic nerve, vagus nerve, gut, heart, skin) influence perception/emotions but do not directly hold “thoughts.”

⸻

🔬 Technology Today
	•	Direct thought access requires surgery (implants like Neuralink, Utah Array).
	•	Non-invasive methods:
	•	EEG → reads brainwave patterns (focus, stress, sleep states).
	•	fMRI / MEG / NIRS → show which brain areas are active; can reconstruct rough images or words in controlled labs.
	•	No publicly known tech can implant sensors in the brain without surgery or visible medical procedures.

⸻

🕵️ Beyond Public Science (Speculative/Research-Stage)
	•	Nano-sensors (injected or inhaled) → discussed in nanomedicine, not proven in humans.
	•	Neural dust / graphene electronics → experimental concepts.
	•	Remote neural monitoring → claims exist but not supported by mainstream evidence.
	•	If such things exist, they would still need power and wireless communication, which could be detectable.

✅ Detecting Hidden Implants or Sensors

Medical Imaging
	1.	Full-body X-ray → finds metallic/foreign objects.
	2.	CT scan → high-resolution check for tiny implants.
	3.	MRI (if no metal seen first) → detects soft, non-metallic objects.
	4.	Ultrasound → good for shallow/surface implants.
	5.	Dental panoramic X-ray → checks jaw/sinuses.

Lab/Body Tests
	•	Blood markers for inflammation.
	•	Skin exam/biopsy for superficial lumps.

Technical Checks
	•	RF spectrum sweep (with Software-Defined Radio) → looks for wireless transmissions.
	•	Near-field RF probes → detect local emitters.
	•	Bluetooth/NFC scans → check for hidden wireless devices.
	•	Run tests in shielded/low-signal areas (Faraday setting) to reduce background noise.

Environmental Controls
	•	Switch off Wi-Fi/smart devices and re-test.
	•	Use Faraday bags for personal electronics.

📌 Bottom Line
	•	Publicly known science says thought-reading requires surgery or bulky scanners.
	•	Claims of “scarless implants” exist but are unverified.
	•	If you suspect implants:
	1.	Get X-ray/CT/MRI imaging.
	2.	Run RF sweeps to detect wireless emissions.
	3.	If a lump exists, ask for ultrasound/biopsy.
	•	If all scans are clear and no signals are detected → hidden implants are very unlikely.
