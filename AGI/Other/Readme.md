### Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI

**Summary:**

The study examines Bing Copilot conversations to understand how people use AI in work-related tasks, what tasks AI is capable of, and the implications for different occupations. A key outcome is an **AI applicability score** that reflects how well AI can support or perform tasks in various jobs.

### Key Findings:

* **Strongest alignment**: Generative AI aligns most with **knowledge work and communication-based occupations**.
* **Limited impact**: Occupations involving **manual labor or physical tasks** show minimal AI applicability.
* **Socioeconomic patterns**:

  * Slight positive correlation between AI applicability and **wages**.
  * Higher applicability in jobs requiring a **Bachelor’s degree**.
  * AI's potential exists across **all income and education levels**.
* **AI supports more than performs**:

  * AI often assists users rather than fully completing tasks.
  * Most common tasks: **gathering information, writing, communication**.
  * AI acts as a **coach or advisor**, not a full worker replacement.
* **Limitations**:

  * Data from only one AI (Copilot); doesn't reflect all user demographics or other platforms.
  * Task data derived from O\*NET (U.S.-centric and potentially outdated).
  * Hard to distinguish between work vs. leisure usage in AI chats.

### Broader Implications:

* AI isn’t replacing entire jobs but **overlaps unevenly** with various tasks.
* **Task success varies**; overlap doesn’t mean full task completion.
* **Historical lessons** (e.g., ATMs increasing bank teller jobs) caution against assuming job loss from automation.
* Future job structures may change, and **entirely new roles may emerge**.
* Ongoing research is needed to **track AI’s evolving frontier** and its real impact on work.
