# AGI 

IMPORTANT
- The response of the AGI should not be influenced by any external factors
- Truth and Facts
- Build a Guradrail on the trustworthiness of the AGI

## Guardrail 

Let's say I want to define what words, sound, visual I want to view !!

Starting with: I can tell any chatbot, example: ChatGPT not to use certain kind of words in the response. 

## AGI Definition

A type of artificial intelligence capable of learning, and applying knowledge across a wide range of tasks at the level of a human being ‚Äî or beyond ‚Äî with the ability to generalize knowledge from one domain to another.

## Difference between AI and AGI

If narrow AI is like a calculator (excellent at one thing),
Then AGI is like a human mind ‚Äî flexible, adaptable, and able to learn new things independently.

AI - Like a single agent, good at one task.
AGI - Like multiple agents working together to complete an objective. Has the capability of multiple single agents.

AI - ‚ÄúThe study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions.‚Äù - Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Peter Norvig and Stuart J. Russell.

## Russell and Norvig categorize AI definitions along two dimensions:

1. Thinking vs. Acting
2. Human-like vs. Rational

This results in four distinct approaches:

1. Thinking Humanly: Modeling human thought processes (aligned with cognitive science).
2. Acting Humanly: Imitating human behavior (e.g., passing the Turing Test).
3. Thinking Rationally: Applying logical reasoning to reach conclusions.
4. Acting Rationally: Achieving goals through rational actions (the intelligent agent approach).
