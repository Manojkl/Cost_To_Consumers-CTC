## Sources of Electricity Generation in India

India's electricity generation comes from a diverse mix of sources, with a growing emphasis on renewable energy. Here’s a breakdown of the main sources as of 2023:

---

### **1. Thermal Power (71% of total electricity generation)**
#### **Coal (50-55%)**
   - Largest source of electricity in India.
   - India is one of the world's top coal producers, with major coal power plants like NTPC Vindhyachal.
   - Challenges: High carbon emissions and pollution.

#### **Natural Gas (6-8%)**
   - Used for power generation in areas where gas supply is adequate.
   - Major gas power plants include Dabhol Power Plant (Maharashtra).
   - Challenges: Dependence on imported LNG (liquefied natural gas).

#### **Oil (Less than 1%)**
   - Used primarily for backup or emergency power in remote areas.

---

### **2. Renewable Energy (28-30%)**
#### **Solar Power (13-14%)**
   - India is one of the top solar energy producers globally.
   - Major solar farms: Bhadla Solar Park (Rajasthan), Pavagada Solar Park (Karnataka).
   - Initiatives: National Solar Mission, International Solar Alliance.

#### **Wind Power (10-11%)**
   - Key wind-producing states: Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Rajasthan.
   - Largest wind farm: Muppandal Wind Farm (Tamil Nadu).

#### **Hydropower (11-12%)**
   - India has a significant number of hydropower plants, particularly in the Himalayan states.
   - Major projects: Tehri Dam (Uttarakhand), Bhakra-Nangal (Punjab/Himachal Pradesh).
   - Small hydropower projects also contribute to rural electrification.

#### **Biomass and Waste-to-Energy (2-3%)**
   - Utilizes agricultural residue, municipal solid waste, and other biomass.
   - Examples: Bagasse-based cogeneration in sugar mills.

---

### **3. Nuclear Power (2-3%)**
   - Major contributor to low-carbon electricity.
   - Operated by Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL).
   - Major nuclear power plants: 
     - Kudankulam (Tamil Nadu)
     - Tarapur (Maharashtra)
     - Kakrapar (Gujarat)
   - Fuel: Uranium sourced domestically and imported.

---

### **4. Imports (Less than 1%)**
   - India imports electricity from neighboring countries like Bhutan, which generates surplus hydropower.

---

### **Trends and Initiatives in India’s Electricity Generation**
- **Renewable Energy Goals:**
  - Target of achieving **500 GW** of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.
  - Focus on expanding solar and wind capacity.
  
- **Energy Efficiency:**
  - Implementation of advanced grid systems and energy-saving programs (e.g., UJALA for LED distribution).
  
- **Coal Dependency Reduction:**
  - Efforts to phase out inefficient coal plants and adopt cleaner coal technologies.

- **Electrification:**
  - Major programs like **Saubhagya** for rural electrification have made electricity accessible to over 99% of households.

India’s energy mix reflects a strong push toward renewables, even as coal remains a dominant contributor due to its vast reserves and existing infrastructure.
