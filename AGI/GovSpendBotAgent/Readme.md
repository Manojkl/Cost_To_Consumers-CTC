# Government Spending Tracking
This project focuses on analyzing and monitoring government spending patterns.

Using a Large Language Model (LLM) trained on government data, including state spending and implementation metrics, the project will associate expenditures with the responsible officials or politicians. It will provide monthly reports and evaluations based on public data in a multimodal format.

## How It Works
The LLM is trained and fine-tuned on government spending data across daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly intervals. It can provide real-time answers to questions related to spending patterns and generate comprehensive reports that break down expenditures by department or project. Users can access reports on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis to monitor spending trends and hold accountable those responsible. The project will also assess the outcomes of these expenditures.

## Features
- Monitor and analyze government spending patterns while generating detailed reports and tag it with the responsible person.
- Provide real-time feedback to the public regarding spending trends.
- Issue alerts if expenditures exceed specified limits.
- Multimodel and Multilingual.
- A ML model that trained on past data and can predict the expenditure.
- Anomaly detection
