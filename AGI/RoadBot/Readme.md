To do:

Project Goals:
Objective: Use AI and automation to improve transparency and accountability in road infrastructure projects.

Tasks:
✅ Automate Detection: Identify and classify road conditions (e.g., potholes, damage types) using computer vision and/or other techniques, including context such as nearby landmarks or shops.

📊 Automated Reporting: Generate comprehensive reports based on the detected road conditions.

📨 Authority Escalation: Automatically send reports and video evidence to relevant authorities (e.g., ministers, departments) and link this data to their respective Wikipedia pages or public records for transparency.

🎶 Audio Integration: Automatically generate music for the video, incorporating department names, officials involved, and context-related lyrics.

🔁 Ongoing Monitoring: Periodically reassess the road conditions (e.g., every few weeks/months) and track the quality of repairs or changes over time.

💰 Financial Accountability: Extract and compile information on the budget, expenditure, and responsible officials for each road project.

⭐ Rating System: Develop a public-facing rating or scoring system based on road quality, repair frequency, and authority response.

Time taken to repair: Monitor the response time of the department and people to repair/construct. 
Add these details to their Wikipedia profiles.
