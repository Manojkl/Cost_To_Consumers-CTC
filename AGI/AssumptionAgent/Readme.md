# AssumptionAgent

A Agent that helps to give the assumptions/context to be made when generating the output for a input prompt.

- A predefined prompt that works for particular LLMs and particular task that gives out response such that the probability of correct response is high.
- ...etc


# Impact Factor

Here‚Äôs an improved breakdown of global time savings thanks to LLMs and generative AI‚Äîespecially when users provide good context and manage assumptions properly:

---

## üî¢ Key Statistics on Time Saved

* **Microsoft Copilot ‚Äî UK public sector**: Average **26 minutes saved per user per day**, which equals roughly **two weeks annually** for each civil servant ([barrons.com][1], [ft.com][2]).

* **Microsoft Copilot ‚Äî Australia (Telstra)**: Around **20 hours saved per user each month**‚Äîabout **5 hours per week** ([theaustralian.com.au][3]).

* **Google AI studies ‚Äî administrative tasks**: **122 hours saved per worker per year** (\~2.3 hours per week) .

* **Adecco survey across 35k employees**: Average of **1 hour saved per user per day**, consistent across many industries ([insights.talintpartners.com][4]).

* **HubSpot on sales teams**: Sales professionals save **2 hours 15 minutes daily** (\~11 hours per week) ([businessinsider.com][5]).

* **Thomson Reuters (professionals)**: Professionals forecast **4 hours per week saved** within the next year (\~200 hours/year) and up to **12 hours weekly** within five years ([thomsonreuters.com][6]).

* **AI virtual assistants (e.g. chatbots)**: Over **14 billion hours saved globally in 2022** ([gitnux.org][7]).

* **Pearson projection (workers globally)**: By 2026, generative AI could save **51 million hours every week** through automating routine tasks ([reddit.com][8]).

## üåç Aggregated Global Impact

* Extrapolations suggest **tens of billions of hours annually** saved worldwide‚Äîdriven by:

  * **Corporate AI adoption** (e.g., Copilot, virtual assistants)
  * **SME use** for repetitive tasks
  * **Generative LLM usage** by professionals, sales teams, public servants

* For example, if **100 million users** each save just **1 hour/week**, that‚Äôs **100 million hours per week**, or \~**5 billion hours per year** (\~2.5 million person-years).

## ‚úÖ Role of Prompting & Context

Providing **clear context and explicit guidance** enables LLMs to:

1. **Interpret correctly** (e.g., domain, detail, format)
2. **Avoid rework** due to irrelevant, vague, or inaccurate completions
3. **Minimize user tuning and prompt iteration**

‚Üí This boosts **per-interaction efficiency**, compounding across billions of interactions.

So, **proper prompting** doesn‚Äôt just refine output‚Äîit **multiplies the time saved** across all users and uses.

---

## üß† Estimating Market-wide Savings

* Assume conservative efficiency gains:

  * **1 hour/week per user** √ó **200M users** = **200M hours/week** ‚Üí \~**10B hours/year**.
* If better prompting doubles that to **2‚ÄØhrs/week**, we reach \~**20B hours saved annually**.
* In years ahead, as **AI adoption scales**, **total savings may exceed 50B hours per year**.

---

### üß© In Summary

* **Users**: gain 1‚Äì2‚ÄØhours per day across many roles.
* **Organizations**: report 122h‚Äì400h saved annually per employee.
* **Global scale**: tens of billions of hours saved per year‚Äîworth trillions in economic value.

üîπ And **prompt engineering** is key: by clarifying assumptions and giving precise context, organizations can unlock **far greater efficiency**‚Äînot just modest improvements.
